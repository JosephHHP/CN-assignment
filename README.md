Client - Server programme

This project contains two programs that are able to communicate with each other. The two programs are client and Server. The Server conncet to a port and wait for the client to conncet to the same port. Once the connection is complete, the client have the power to make the serever do certain tasks. In this project, those tasks are-

1. Create a file named f1.txt with "Hellow World" as its content.
2. Display the content of the file f1.txt onto the terminal.
3. Edit the content inside the file.
4. Delete file f1.txt

Once the word "over" is entered in the client terminal, the connection will be terminated.
