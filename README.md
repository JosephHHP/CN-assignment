In this project, those tasks are-

1. Create a file named f1.txt with "Hellow World" as its contenet.
2. Display the content of the file f1.txt onto the terminal.
3. Edit the content inside the file.
4. Delete file f1.txt

Once the word "over" is entered in the client terminal, the connection will be terminated.
